# CPU_RayTracing
This project so far is just an excuse for me to learn Rust :smile:

## Setup
- Install Rust with rustup: [Getting started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
- Download SDL2 from [the SDL latest release page](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/latest), download the file ending in **VC.zip** (currently, _SDL2-devel-2.26.5-VC.zip_)
- Clone this repository
- In this project's directory, open a command prompt and run this command: `cargo run`
